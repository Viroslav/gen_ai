The VideoQADataset class extends the [PyTorch Dataset](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/data_tutorial.html) class to facilitate loading and processing \"MMBench\". This class will handle the conversion of dataset samples into the format required for training and evaluation by preparing a prompt and making array from videos.\n",

In this section, you need to define the InternVLModelPLModule, a custom PyTorch Lightning module that encapsulates the model, training loop, validation loop, and optimizer configuration.\n",

        "- an evaluation step consists of making the model autoregressively complete the prompt using the generate() method. After that, you compute an evaluation metric between the predicted sequences and the ground truth ones. This allows you to see how the model is improving over the course of training. The metric we use here is accuracy of answering the question.\n",
        "\n",
        "Besides that, you define the optimizer to use (AdamW is a good default choice) and the data loaders, which use the collate functions defined above to batch together items of the PyTorch datasets. Do note that AdamW is a pretty heavy optimizer in terms of memory requirements, but as we're training with QLoRa we only need to store optimizer states for the adapter layers. For full fine-tuning, one could take a look at more memory friendly optimizers such as 8-bit Adam."
